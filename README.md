Welcome!

This is part of the master thesis works. Two files contain: 1) the Python code for developing AI models using traditional machine learning and deep learning algorithms with both MFCC and SVD-based Spectrogram, and 2) the Python code for developing the user interface to ease the user's access, so-called SIMA.
